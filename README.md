- 👋 Privyet! I’m @ruslanworkyard. Platform engineer, PHP code wrangler, and sysadmin of steel. If it runs on a server, I can tame it.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating systems that are both heavy and reliable. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make the cloud bend to my will while keeping feet firmly in command line.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where efficiency meets chaos, and where tough problems are wrestled into submission.
- 📫 How to reach me? Call my number, talk at beep.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Once automated a deployment pipeline ran so perfectly it made the machines cry tears of joy—or maybe it was just a server cooling leak. Same thing.
